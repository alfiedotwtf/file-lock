# NAME

file-lock - File locking via POSIX advisory record locks

This crate provides the facility to lock and unlock a file following the
advisory record lock scheme as specified by UNIX IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (POSIX.1)
via fcntl().

# USAGE

    extern crate file_lock;

    use file_lock::{FileLock, FileOptions};
    use std::io::prelude::*;

    fn main() {
        let should_we_block  = true;
        let lock_for_writing = FileOptions::new().write(true).create_new(true);

        let mut filelock = match FileLock::lock("myfile.txt", should_we_block, lock_for_writing) {
            Ok(lock) => lock,
            Err(err) => panic!("Error getting write lock: {}", err),
        };

        filelock.file.write_all(b"Hello, World!").is_ok();

        // Manually unlocking is optional as we unlock on Drop
        filelock.unlock();
    }
